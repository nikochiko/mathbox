# Mathbox

Simple Math toolbox, built completely with client-side JavaScript.

## This includes a Scheme interpreter!

I wanted to have a simple calculator that allows some complex functions
such as factorial, floor and ceil, permutations and combinations, etc.
to allow me to write simple calculation steps. So that's part of this,
and it comes pre-loaded with some functions.

You can do all your basic calculations and use these functions. You can
add your own with JavaScript, but you can't define your own. Yet. I wanted
to keep the parser simple but I plan on adding that functionality some day.
